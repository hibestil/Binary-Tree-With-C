# Binary-Tree-With-C

This program creates a simple Binary tree.

In computer science, a binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a triple (L, S, R), where L and R are binary trees or the empty set and S is a singleton set.Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well.[1]

More tree terminology:

    The depth of a node is the number of edges from the root to the node.
    The height of a node is the number of edges from the node to the deepest leaf.
    The height of a tree is a height of the root.
    A full binary tree.is a binary tree in which each node has exactly zero or two children.
    A complete binary tree is a binary tree, which is completely filled, with the possible exception of the bottom level, which is filled from left to right. [2]
